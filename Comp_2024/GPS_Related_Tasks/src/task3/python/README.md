# Python Folder Info

Hi Ed! Here is what you need to know about the ROS2 side of things!

- the subscriber to the urg_node needs to be in detector.py so when you are creating your stuff plese include the contents of `docking_LiDAR_grab.py' within
	-There is going to be a publisher which I put the outlines for in this .py script
-the subscriber to the detector.py publisher is needed to be in MainControl.py so put info from *insert script name here when done* into the final MainControl.py for this task
