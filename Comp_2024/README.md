# Comp_2024_Folder

This is the folder where all algorithms/code/virtual components will be stored. For ease of cross work between members please follow the procedures below!

## Folders

- GPS_Related_Tasks: Tasks 1, 2, and 8 will be stored here. Unless we want to do what a paid group did over years in a month we need ROS2 driver so this will be the ros2 workspace. If anything else needs a waypoint please put it here and Barbee will work on it. 
- Indiv_Tasks: This is where Tasks that are finished will go that do not require GPS implementation. 

## Tasks to be done overall for Competition (Add as needed and delete from list below when finished)
- GPS
	- Information needed
	- Lat/long (1+8 maybe 5)
	- Yaw (2)
- LiDAR 
	- figure out CDC ACM
	- Return home
	- Docking
	
- YOLOv5 datasets
	- Put updated ones in both folders to make this easier
- Task 1
	- Change part to grab inital waypoint and store as variable
- Task 2 
	- Move into GPS folder
	- Check pseudo for actual with new datasets
	- add code that grabs waypoint/heading at end of course for spins
- Task 3
	- Move into Indiv folder
	- Pics for posters
	- Train for posters
	- Pool testing for psuedo code
- Task 4
	- Create code in Indiv Folder
	- See task3 for poster training
	- add code that gets waypoint before start of task to make sure watergun does not blow boat too far away
	- pool testing 
	- Update code as needed
   
- Task 5 (Would be nice)
	- Move into GPS folder
	- Add piece that checks for correct channel (do not accidentally go through task2 again)
	- Buoy training
	- Pool tests
	- LiDAR
- Task 8
	- Create code in GPS folder
	- Implement GPS
	- Have it call Task 1
	- Test logic (does not need to be pool)
