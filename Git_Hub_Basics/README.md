# Github Help

Hi

## Basics
If you remember nothing else do these things:
- `git clone https://github.com/DarkAngelRed/RoboBoat_Cyber_Minority.git`: grabs everything stored in this repo and copies it to your system
- `git add Roboboat_Cyber_Minority.git`: Converts the local file into a .git repo
	- From here `cd` into the folder which you have ran this code on
	- From here before you can commit you may need to set an email and user to commit as
		- `git config --global user.email "youremail@here"`
		- `git config --global user.name "usernamehere"`
- `git add .`: Allows for all changes to be added including things getting deleted/added/changed
- `git commit -m "first commit"`: If this runs correctly it will show all changes in the commit
- `git push`: Push the commit to GitHub

## Authentication 
 Use `gh`. In order to get things linked up properly use this and after it is properly upgraded run the command `gh auth login` to link your account to this device.
