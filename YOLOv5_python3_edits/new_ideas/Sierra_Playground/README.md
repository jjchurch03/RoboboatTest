# Sierra's Playground

This is where 1/c Barbee's attempts will be stored with python code before being implemented into the main cade section

## Table of contents

- detector.py: updated to change defaults
- black_and_yellow_sudo.py: sudo code in anticipation to training for our new black and yellow buoys. Hopefully the buoy counter for yellow buoys works as well
