# New Code

## Ideas for updates
  - Properly code MainControl.py so it runs smoothly and exits withot error and we can kill it from cmdline
  - Comment old detector.py and figure out how to set it up so we can just type `python3 detector.py`
  - Set up main file which can be used to make code more effecent
     - Have the eyes detect colors and based on the colors it will call certain .py codes after waiting a few seconds each call.
     - Figure out ways to count a yellow bouy once and only once (maybe having it count it when it reaches a certain distance away and disappears?)
     -
     -
  - Change how move_to_center works in MainControl.py in both class ZedObjects and ""
      - have a delay so it isn't constantly running
   
  - Fix if statements in object_detection.py
