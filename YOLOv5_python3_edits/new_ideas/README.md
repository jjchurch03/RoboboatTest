# New Code

## Ideas for updates
  - Set up main file which can be used to make code more effecent
     - Have the eyes detect colors and based on the colors it will call certain .py codes after waiting a few seconds each call.
     - Figure out ways to count a yellow bouy once and only once (maybe having it count it when it reaches a certain distance away and disappears?)
  - Fix if statements in object_detection.py
