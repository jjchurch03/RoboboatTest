CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddetector.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "detector",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "detector" with any
  of the following names:

    detectorConfig.cmake
    detector-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "detector" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "detector_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "detector" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
