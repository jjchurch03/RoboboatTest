CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindMyCustomMsg.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "MyCustomMsg", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "MyCustomMsg" with
  any of the following names:

    MyCustomMsgConfig.cmake
    mycustommsg-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "MyCustomMsg" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "MyCustomMsg_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "MyCustomMsg" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
